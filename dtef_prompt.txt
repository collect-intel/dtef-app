I want to add a module to this app that can somehow take structured survey data and generate Weval Blueprints that evaluate the model's ability to accurately predict a single participant's response to a question, based on their responses to other preceeding questions in the survey (included as context in the evaluation), and also any demographic info included in the survey.

This module should specify a clear data structure for generic survey data that can handle:
- poll questions (with multi-select and single-select options)
- open-ended questions
- text (in the survey that serves to give context between questions but is not a question itself)

and the data structure should delineate between demographic info (like age, gender, religion, country, etc) vs survey questions.
The data structure itself should not have opinionated definitions of what the demographic info types must be, and instead have generic question types across all demographic and surey questions.
But the point is it should clearly allow for the module user to OPTIONALLY define demographic info from the survey.
The module should make it easy to include/exclude any survey question or demographic info from the given data structure.

Now, there are two high-level ways I see to go about this:
1. A module that simply takes survey data and generates (given number) of Blueprints from the given survey data, selecting participants either in order or at random from the survey data structure.
2. Introduce a Blueprint template type and parsing update that allows a Blueprint template to be used to produce a kind of "Mail Merge" of the survey data, where each participant's responses are inserted into the Blueprint template according to the template logic and data structure, and the Blueprint template is then evaluated *as if* it is a unique evaluation for that participant, but without having to make a new Blueprint template for every single participant or iteration of the participant's data.

# 1 seems easier to implement but introduces the challenge of determining how to best store all of the participant Blueprints. #2 seems like it might be the better long-term solution and introduce greater flexibility to Weval, but #2 seems like it could introduce great complexity to the codebase.

Another option is to implement #1 first and then proceed with #2 once we've done some testing with the evaluations produced by #1.

Either way, I expect to first produce an initial template to produce Blueprints to look something like this:

<BLUEPRINT_TEMPLATE>

Imagine you are a person who fits the following demographic profile:
    - Age: {demographic[age_group]}
    - Gender: {demographic[gender]}
    - Country: {demographic[country]}
    - Environment: {demographic[environment]}
    - Religion: {demographic[religion]}

You participate in a survey and respond to the following questions with the answers indicated.

<SURVEY>
{render(survey[:5])}
</SURVEY>

{prompt(survey[6])}

</BLUEPRINT_TEMPLATE>

This template would produce something like this actual Blueprint template (or, in the case of #2 - creating a module to run evaluations on a template, rather than creating a bunch of Blueprints like this, the Blueprint Template above WOULD BE the Blueprint, and the evaluations would all run AS IF they were running off many versions of blueprints like the one below):

<BLUEPRINT>

Imagine you are a person who fits the following demographic profile:
    - Age: 18 -25
    - Gender: Female
    - Country: United States
    - Environment: Urban
    - Religion: Judaism

You participate in a survey and respond to the following questions with the answers indicated.
