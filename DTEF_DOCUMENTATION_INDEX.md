## 🚀 Quick Start for New Coding Agents

**Start here if you're new to the project:**

1. **Read First (30 minutes):**
   - `DTEF_OVERVIEW.md` - Understand what DTEF is and why it exists
   - `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Understand DTEF vs Weval, key differences

2. **Read Second (30 minutes):**
   - `DTEF_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - ⭐ **ESSENTIAL** - How to work on this project
   - `DTEF_TASK_PLAN.md` - ⭐ **ESSENTIAL** - Your detailed task roadmap

3. **Reference as Needed:**
   - `DTEF_PROJECT_PLAN.md` - High-level implementation plan
   - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Weval architecture (DTEF is based on this)

## 🎯 For Different Roles

### If You're a Coding Agent Starting Work

1. **Read:** `DTEF_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` (complete guide)
2. **Check:** `DTEF_TASK_PLAN.md` - See current task status
3. **Start:** Phase 0, Task 0.1 (or next uncompleted task)
4. **Reference:** `DTEF_TASK_PLAN.md` for detailed task steps

### If You're Reviewing the Project

1. **Read:** `DTEF_OVERVIEW.md` - Understand project goals
2. **Read:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Understand architecture decisions
3. **Review:** `DTEF_PROJECT_PLAN.md` - See high-level plan
4. **Check:** `DTEF_TASK_PLAN.md` - See detailed progress

### If You're Making Architecture Decisions

1. **Read:** `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` - Understand what to preserve vs change
2. **Read:** `DTEF_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Understand architecture principles

## 📝 Document Maintenance

**When to update documentation:**

- **After completing a phase:** Update task status in `DTEF_TASK_PLAN.md`
- **After architecture changes:** Update `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `DTEF_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **After major decisions:** Document in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
- **After adding features:** Update relevant sections in `DTEF_TASK_PLAN.md`

**Document owners:**
- All agents are responsible for keeping documentation up to date
- Update docs as you work, not after

---

## 🆘 Getting Help

1. **Check documentation first** - Most questions are answered in these docs
2. **Review similar code** - Look for existing patterns
3. **Check task plan** - See if your question is addressed in task details
4. **Document the issue** - If you find a gap, document it for future agents
