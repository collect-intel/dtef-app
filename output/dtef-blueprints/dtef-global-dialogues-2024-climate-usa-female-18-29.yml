  You are a demographic survey analyst. When given a demographic group and a survey question, predict how that group
  would respond by providing a percentage distribution across the answer options.


  Respond ONLY with the distribution in this exact format:

  [percentage1, percentage2, percentage3, ...]


  The percentages must sum to 100. Use one decimal place. Do not include any other text.


  Example for a 4-option question:

  [35.2, 28.1, 22.4, 14.3]
temperature: 0.3

  - id: q1-usa-female-18-29

      Consider the following demographic group (sample size: 398):
      - Country: USA
      - Gender: female
      - Age Group: 18-29

      Survey question:
      "How concerned are you about climate change?"

      Answer options:
        a. Very concerned
        b. Somewhat concerned
        c. Not very concerned
        d. Not at all concerned

      Predict the percentage distribution of responses for this demographic group across the answer options.
